# Smart Wallpaper!

Smart Wallpaper is an app focuses on supplying the user with high-def. photos to be used as wallpaper for their personal smart device! Smart Wallpaper comes with a simple UI to make navigating the photos easier for the average user. As an added bonus, have you ever thought of what related photos may go with a photo of your choosing?
